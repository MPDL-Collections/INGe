AB Widespread distribution of Japanese comics (manga) is part of a global
   youth culture that can be viewed as a knowledge society. The paper
   presents research in progress about how knowledge is being "framed" by
   young people through established forms or structures, through
   discipline associated with active learning and participation, and
   through thoughtful reflection and discussion with peers. Historical and
   qualitative methodologies are emphasized.
