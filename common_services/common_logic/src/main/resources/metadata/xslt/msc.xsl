It replaces the 1991 MSC and is effective (in MR) with the January 2000 issue (2000a). While in many areas in the MSC there are only very small changes, others have been expanded significantly, and in some areas there is an altogether new classification. The major changes are as follows: Section 04 has been eliminated; 03E will now be used for items previously classified in 04. A new section, 37, has been created for Dynamical systems and ergodic theory; as a result Section 58F has been eliminated. Also in Section 58, 58G has been completely revised and now appears as 58J. The new Section 74, Mechanics of deformable solids, is a completely revised version of Section 73, which has been eliminated. The areas covered by Sections 90 and 92 have been reorganized into Sections 90, 91 and 92. Sections 90B and 90C remain essentially unchanged. The new Section 91A replaces 90D and 91B replaces 90A. The other subsections of 91 replace the old subsections 92G, H, J and K. Sections 92B, C, D, and E remain essentially unchanged. MSC2000 contains a new section, 97, for Mathematics education. This will be used only as a secondary classification in MR. Other sections with significant additions or reorganization include 14, 22, 32, 34, 46, 47, 53, and 65. To help users of the MSC, conversion tables have been constructed and are available on the AMS web site, www.ams.org. These give, for each 1991 classification that does not appear in MSC2000, the classification(s) in MSC2000 that are most likely to be used for items that would previously have been classified using the old classification, and, for each new classification in MSC2000, the classification(s) in the 1991 MSC that are most likely to have been used earlier for items classified using the new classification. Instructions for using the Mathematics Subject Classification 2000 These instructions apply uniformly to all fields listed. The main purpose of the classification is to help readers find the items of present or potential interest to them as readily as possible— in MR, in Zbl, or anywhere else where this classification system is used. A paper or book should be listed under the classification where it will receive the broadest attention from readers possibly interested in it—these include both people working in that area and people who are familiar with that area and apply its results and methods elsewhere (inside or outside mathematics). It will be extremely useful for both readers and classifiers to familiarize themselves with the entire classification system and thus to become aware of all the classifications of possible interest to them. For every paper or book listed, MR chooses precisely one “primary” classification, which is simply the code for the section (MSC entry) in which the item will be located. This section should be the one that covers the principal contribution. When an item contains several principal contributions in different areas, the primary classification should cover the “most important” among them. A paper or book may receive one or several “secondary” classifications (or “cross-references”) to cover any remaining principal contributions, ancillary results, motivation or origin of the problems discussed, intended or potential field of application, or other significant aspects worthy of notice. The “primary” principal contribution is meant to be the one including the most important part of the work actually done in the item under consideration. For example, a paper whose main overall content is the solution of a problem in graph theory, which arose in computer science and whose solution is, say, at present only of interest to computer scientists, belongs primarily in 05C with a cross-reference in 68; conversely, a paper whose overall content lies mainly in computer science should receive a primary classification in 68, even if it makes heavy use of graph theory and proves several new graph-theoretic results along the way. There are two types of cross-references given after many classifications in the list. The first type is of the form “{For A, see X}”; if this appears in section Y, it means that for contributions described by A one should usually assign the classification X, not Y. The other type of cross-reference merely points out related classifications; it is of the form “[See also . . . ]”, “[See mainly . . . ]”, etc., and the classifications listed in the brackets may, but need not, be added to the classification of a paper, or they may be used in place of the classification where the cross-reference is given. The classifier will have to judge which classification is the most appropriate for the item at hand.</xsl:when>
