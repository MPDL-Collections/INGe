  abstract =     "Goal-directed evaluation is a very expressive
                 programming language paradigm that is supported in
                 relatively few languages. It is characterized by
                 evaluation of expressions in an attempt to meet some
                 goal, with resumption of previous expressions on
                 failure. This paradigm is found in SNOBL4 in its
                 pattern-matching facilities, and in Icon as a general
                 part of the language. This paper presents a
                 denotational semantics of Icon and shows how Icon is in
                 fact a combination of two distinct paradigms,
                 goal-directed evaluation and functional application.
                 The two paradigms are not supported separately in
                 different contexts, but integrated fully into a single
                 evaluation mechanism.",
