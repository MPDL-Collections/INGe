		<h1>About eSciDoc</h1>
		
		eSciDoc is as a joint project of the
		<a class="external" href="http://www.mpg.de/">Max Planck Society</a>
		<img class="outlink"
			src="http://www.escidoc-project.de/JSPWiki/images/out.png" alt="">
		and
		<a class="external" href="http://www.fiz-karlsruhe.de/">FIZ
		Karlsruhe</a>
		<img class="outlink"
			src="http://www.escidoc-project.de/JSPWiki/images/out.png" alt="">
		, funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), with
		the aim to realize a next-generation platform for communication and
		publication in research organizations.
		<br>
		<br>
		
		
		The result of the entire eSciDoc project is intended to ensure open and
		persistent access to the research results and materials of the Max
		Planck Society and to integrate these materials in an emerging e-Science
		network, to increase the accountability of research and to improve the
		visibility of the Max Planck Society. At the same time, the project aims
		to provide effective and comprehensive access to information for Max
		Planck researchers and their work groups. Additionally, eSciDoc will
		support scientific collaboration and interdisciplinary research in
		future e-Science scenarios and optimize the exploitation of information
		available through an interconnected global scientific knowledge space.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		
		Advances in science, scientific activities and processes will arise from
		unhindered international collaboration among scholars. To exempt
		researchers from barriers of physical location of knowledge (data) and
		know-how (individuals), a solid
		<a class="wikipage"
			href="http://www.escidoc-project.de/JSPWiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Infrastructure">infrastructure</a>
		to provide data storage, interoperability and seamless integration into
		community-specific working environments is necessary. The technical and
		technological means provided by a scientific infrastructure are
		fundamentals in enabling e-Science, however, the essential requirement
		to enable innovation and research is the adequate working environment
		for scholarly communities.
		<br>
		<br>
		
		
		
		Even within a discipline, the requirements for a specific
		<a class="wikipage"
			href="http://www.escidoc-project.de/JSPWiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Solutions">solution</a>
		might differ, be it in presentation aspects or functionalities.
		Therefore, the functional requirements for the eSciDoc project are
		threefold: provide community-specific solutions which serve the needs of
		a specific research group or research question, provide standardized
		interfaces for other communities or systems to re-use data and
		functionalities and provide adequate user interfaces and viewing
		environments where necessary.
