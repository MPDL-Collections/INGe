		                    publicly visible.</span>

		            <p class="MsoNormal">
		                <span style="" lang="EN-GB"> In addition to the diverse workflows, there are also different user
		                    roles with varying privileges. These roles principally remain the same,
		                    whereas their rights may vary according to the workflow. A "depositor",
		                    for instance, is always a person that submits data (e.g. a scientist).
		                    A moderator, on the other hand, cannot submit data &#8211; s/he can 
		                    only modify or complement them (e.g. a librarian). </span>

		            <p class="MsoNormal">
