About eSciDoc</h1>


  

  

  

  eSciDoc is as a joint project of the <a class="external" href="http://www.mpg.de/">Max Planck Society</a><img class="outlink" src="http://www.escidoc-project.de/JSPWiki/images/out.png" alt=""> and <a class="external" href="http://www.fiz-karlsruhe.de/">FIZ Karlsruhe</a><img class="outlink" src="http://www.escidoc-project.de/JSPWiki/images/out.png" alt="">,
funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), with
the aim to realize a next-generation platform for communication and
publication in research organizations. <br>
<br>


The result of the entire eSciDoc project is intended to ensure
open and persistent access to the research results and materials of the
Max Planck Society and to integrate these materials in an emerging
e-Science network, to increase the accountability of research and to
improve the visibility of the Max Planck Society. At the same time, the
project aims to provide effective and comprehensive access to
information for Max Planck researchers and their work groups.
Additionally, eSciDoc will support scientific collaboration and
interdisciplinary research in future e-Science scenarios and optimize
the exploitation of information available through an interconnected
global scientific knowledge space.

<br>
<br>


Advances in science, scientific activities and processes will
arise from unhindered international collaboration among scholars. To
exempt researchers from barriers of physical location of knowledge
(data) and know-how (individuals), a solid <a class="wikipage" href="http://www.escidoc-project.de/JSPWiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Infrastructure">infrastructure</a>
to provide data storage, interoperability and seamless integration into
community-specific working environments is necessary. The technical and
technological means provided by a scientific infrastructure are
fundamentals in enabling e-Science, however, the essential requirement
to enable innovation and research is the adequate working environment
for scholarly communities. <br>
<br>



Even within a discipline, the requirements for a specific <a class="wikipage" href="http://www.escidoc-project.de/JSPWiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Solutions">solution</a>
might differ, be it in presentation aspects or functionalities.
Therefore, the functional requirements for the eSciDoc project are
threefold: provide community-specific solutions which serve the needs
of a specific research group or research question, provide standardized
interfaces for other communities or systems to re-use data and
functionalities and provide adequate user interfaces and viewing
environments where necessary.
